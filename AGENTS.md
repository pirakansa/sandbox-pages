# AGENTS.md

This file is intentionally short to reduce agent context size.

## Always Apply

* Use this top-level `AGENTS.md` for global project rules.
* Follow explicit user prompts first when instructions conflict.
* Before and after code changes, run `npm run test` and `npm run build`; report failures with cause and mitigation.
* Confirm CI-equivalent checks (`npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`) before opening a PR.
